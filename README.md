# Intruder-detection-email-submission
This application/project detects unknown people entered into a specific camera view and sends an alert email to the admin/owner along with sample intruder images. 
Here I used face_recognition python module. It is a dlibâ€™s state-of-the-art face recognition module built with deep learning backend. 
The model has an accuracy of 96%(approx) in detecting intruders.
